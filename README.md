# What is this?
This is a rewrite of Pycord on the new Discord.py rewrite. It's aim is not only to move onto a new version of Discord.py but  to also move on from the caviates that plagued the previous versions of Pycord such as the try spam, lots of untested code and my rather limited knowledge of Python at the beginning of the project

# Use examples of Pycord

This project began when my school blocked Discord. Because of this, I made a Discord message sender and viewer that can be easily ran on something like a VPS or repl.it (which is why it is console based).

With Pycord, you are able to send and recieve messages through a bot (user accounts might be a possibility **soon**)

# Compatibility
